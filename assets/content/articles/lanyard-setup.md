## What is Lanyard?

Lanyard is a lightweight and free API that allows you to retrieve real-time information about a Discord userâ€™s activity. This includes their online status, currently playing game, Spotify song, or any custom status they have set. The API works using WebSockets for instant updates and also provides a REST endpoint for fetching data on demand.

## How Does Lanyard Work?

Lanyard operates using WebSockets, which means it pushes updates instantly whenever a userâ€™s activity changes. This makes it an excellent choice for displaying live Discord statuses without constantly polling an API. The WebSocket connection maintains a persistent link between your website and Lanyardâ€™s servers, ensuring that data updates occur in real-time.

## Setting Up Lanyard on Your Website

### Step 1: Get Your Discord User ID

To use Lanyard, youâ€™ll need your Discord user ID. You can find this by:
1. Enabling Developer Mode in Discord (Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode).
2. Right-clicking your profile in Discord and selecting **Copy ID**.

### Step 2: Establish a WebSocket Connection

To receive live updates, you need to connect to the Lanyard WebSocket API: `wss://api.lanyard.rest/socket` 
Below is a simple JavaScript snippet that connects to Lanyard and logs your Discord activity to the console.

```javascript
const userID = "YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID";
let websocket;
let heartbeatInterval;

function connectWebSocket() {
  websocket = new WebSocket("wss://api.lanyard.rest/socket");

  websocket.onopen = function () {
    console.log("[Lanyard] Connected.");
    websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ op: 2, d: { subscribe_to_id: userID } }));
  };

  websocket.onmessage = function (event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.op === 0) {
      console.log("[Lanyard] User Activity:", data.d);
    } else if (data.op === 1) {
      heartbeatInterval = setInterval(() => websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ op: 3 })), data.d.heartbeat_interval);
    }
  };

  websocket.onclose = function () {
    console.warn("[Lanyard] Connection lost. Reconnecting in 3 seconds...");
    clearInterval(heartbeatInterval);
    setTimeout(connectWebSocket, 3000);
  };
}

connectWebSocket();
```

### Step 3: Displaying the Data on Your Website

You can now update your websiteâ€™s UI using the received data. Hereâ€™s an example that displays the userâ€™s current Discord status:

```html
<div id="statusWrapper">Loading...</div>
```

```javascript
function updateStatus(status) {
  const statusWrapper = document.getElementById("statusWrapper");
  if (statusWrapper) {
    statusWrapper.textContent = status.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + status.slice(1);
  }
}

websocket.onmessage = function (event) {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.op === 0) {
    updateStatus(data.d.discord_status);
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Enhancing with Activity Information

Lanyard also provides details about the userâ€™s current activity, such as playing a game or listening to music. You can extract this information and display it on your site:

```javascript
function updateActivity(activities) {
  const activityElement = document.getElementById("activity");
  if (activities.length > 0) {
    activityElement.textContent = `Playing: ${activities[0].name}`;
  } else {
    activityElement.textContent = "No active status";
  }
}

websocket.onmessage = function (event) {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.op === 0) {
    updateActivity(data.d.activities);
  }
};
```

### Step 5: Styling Your Lanyard Widget

You can style your status display using CSS to make it blend seamlessly with your websiteâ€™s theme:

```css
#statusWrapper {
  font-size: 1.2em;
  font-weight: bold;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

## Conclusion

Lanyard is a simple yet powerful tool that lets you display your real-time Discord activity on your website. By leveraging WebSockets, you can ensure that your status updates instantly. With just a few lines of JavaScript, you can integrate and customize Lanyard to fit your siteâ€™s design and functionality.
